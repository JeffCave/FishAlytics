# FishAlytics

https://fishalytics.smileupps.com/

Serious fisherman know that nothing beats accurate record keeping for knowing 
how and where to catch that next fish. It allows us to identify and know how 
fish behave and where they are likely to be found.

In the past, this meant paper journals spanning decades, but in the 21st 
century, that means FishAdvisor. Rather than just looking across years, we 
offer the ability to compare data from multiple fisherman about conditions 
right now.

Where do you need to cast your line to find your next fish? You find fish where 
the fish are. FishAdvisor knows where they are.
